Energy Watch Spring 2019 Brainstorming

1. Better Grouping and Visualization of building types:
Conduct PCA Analysis and visualize the data in 3 Dimensions - Clustering
^ Use PCA only for visualization but not for the clustering

Use Euclidian Distance between time series data and do agglomerative	hierarchical clustering.

Once data is clustered, plot all the energy signatures for each cluster onto their own plot and find the mean curve.

Seq2Seq model uses neural networks and hidden states for prediction: You could encode time series data as well as other signals (Time of week, weather, etc)
