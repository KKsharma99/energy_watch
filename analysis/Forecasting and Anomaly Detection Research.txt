Seq2Seq model uses neural networks and hidden states for prediction: You could encode time series data as well as other signals (Time of week, weather, etc)


3. Anomaly Detection

4. Data Visualization Dashboard
Key Features:
     - Building type classification by date
     - Forecast of Building Energy Consumption
     - Anomalie Detection

Dashboard that streams the data
