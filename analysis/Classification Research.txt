2019 Spring AE Research Brainstorming

Better Grouping and Visualization of building types:
Conduct PCA Analysis and visualize the data in 3 Dimensions - Clustering
^ Use PCA only for visualization but not for the clustering

Use Euclidian Distance between time series data and do agglomerative	hierarchical clustering.

Once data is clustered, plot all the energy signatures for each cluster onto their own plot and find the mean curve.
